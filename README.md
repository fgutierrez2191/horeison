The Horeison project came to me as a full html file with an attached css style sheet and it was technically a working website. This is a refactor project and the job is to improve upon the code. 
a few things stuck out immedietly. The first thing I did was to go through the css file and add some propor comments and cleaned it up a bit. The html file was also 95% functional. I found while looking at the code that the images did not contain alt attributes and that one of the drop down links were not working, so i fixed those.
